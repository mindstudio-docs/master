# Project Directory Structure Overview

The msModelSlim project tracks the evolutionary trajectory of AI from small models to foundation models.

Initial development introduced compression capabilities including pruning, distillation, and quantization for small models. Following the emergence of foundation models, development progressively shifted toward foundation model quantization techniques.

msModelSlim supports industry-standard foundation model quantization algorithms, including Smooth Quant, GPTQ, and HQQ.

As foundation model architectures grow more complex and quantization bit-widths scale down to a 4-bit configuration or even ultra-low bit-widths, standalone algorithms can no longer simultaneously satisfy performance and accuracy requirements. Consequently, composite strategies have become the standard practice.

Furthermore, the number of foundation models is growing exponentially, posing strict requirements for better tool usability, higher quantization tuning efficiency, and reduced single-model processing duration.

To address these challenges, msModelSlim has developed a hierarchically decoupled framework for foundation model quantization, referred to as the V1 framework. Legacy quantization approaches are categorized under the V0 framework.

You are advised to use the V1 framework, and your contributions to its development are highly welcome.

As the msModelSlim V1 framework is continuously evolving, it does not yet fully encapsulate all capabilities of the V0 framework or previous small model compression features. Legacy code is still required to bridge these functional gaps.

Currently, three codebases coexist within the msModelSlim repository. They are organized into separate directories where possible and will be progressively consolidated in future updates.
