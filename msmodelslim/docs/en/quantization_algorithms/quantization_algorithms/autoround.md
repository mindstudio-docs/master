# AutoRound: Low-bit Quantization Algorithm

## Overview

- **Origin**: A low-bit Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent-based (SignSGD-based) quantization method developed by Intel.
- **Background**: Traditional quantization methods, such as standard rounding, are not the optimal choice for weight quantization. These methods often introduce significant quantization error that substantially reduces model accuracy. This loss is especially pronounced in low-bit scenarios, such as 4-bit quantization or lower.
- **Core idea**: The algorithm introduces learnable rounding offset parameters and uses the SignSGD optimizer to adaptively adjust the rounding direction of each weight. It employs a temperature scheduling strategy to gradually harden the rounding operations, which effectively reduces quantization reconstruction error. This approach achieves an optimal balance between model accuracy and compression efficiency in ultra-low-bit scenarios.

## Principle and Implementation

### Principle

The core idea of AutoRound is to optimize the rounding process for weights. Rather than using standard rounding, the algorithm uses a SignSGD-based approach to adaptively learn the optimal rounding direction (up or down) for each weight while performing targeted adjustments to the scaling factor and zero point.

**Core Formula**

In traditional quantization, the quantization formula of weight `W` is typically as follows:

Ŵ = s × clip(⌊W/s + zp⌉, n, m)

where `s` represents the scaling factor, `zp` represents the zero point, and `n` and `m` represent the lower and upper bounds of the quantized value.

AutoRound introduces a learnable rounding offset `V` and optional scaling factor adjustment parameters `α` and `β`:

`Ŵ = s × clip(⌊W/s + zp + V⌉, n, m)`, `s = (max(W) × α - min(W) × β) / (2^bit - 1)`

where `V` controls the rounding direction, while `α` and `β` are used to adjust the range of the scaling factor.

**Algorithm Process**

As a layer-wise optimization algorithm, it performs the following steps for each decoder layer:

1. **Baseline establishment**: Perform floating-point forward propagation and record the original output as the accuracy baseline.
2. **Parameter initialization**: Initialize the scaling factor and rounding offset, then introduce them into the quantization process as trainable parameters.
3. **Quantization reconstruction**: Perform quantization and dequantization operations, then execute forward propagation to obtain the quantization result.
4. **Loss calculation**: Compare the difference between the quantized output and the floating-point output to calculate the reconstruction loss.
5. **Parameter update**: Update the scaling factor and rounding offset through the SignSGD optimizer.
6. **Iterative optimization**: Repeat steps 1 through 5 until the convergence condition is met or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
7. **Final quantization**: Apply the optimal parameters obtained through iterative training to produce the final quantized weights.

### Implementation

#### Code Implementation

- The algorithm is implemented in [msmodelslim/processor/quant/autoround.py](../../../../msmodelslim/processor/quant/autoround.py), with the core class being `AutoroundQuantProcessor`.

#### Initialization Phase

  * Layer configuration initialization: Read the quantization configuration and allocate the corresponding scheme to each network layer.
  * Parameter pre-allocation: Initialize the floating-point output, quantized output, and optimal parameters.

#### `pre_run` Phase

  * Gradient freezing: Disable automatic gradient calculation for all network layers to prevent direct weight optimization during training.

#### `preprocess` Phase (Executed in a Layer-wise Loop)

  * Baseline output collection: Perform floating-point forward propagation for the current layer and record the floating-point output as the optimization baseline.
  * Linear layer wrapping: Wrap each linear layer to inject trainable scaling factors and rounding offset parameters.
  * Computational graph construction: Construct a differentiable computational graph that includes quantization and dequantization operations to support gradient backpropagation.

#### `process` Phase (Executed in a Layer-wise Loop)

  * Trainer initialization: Set parameters such as the learning rate and iteration count, then configure the SignSGD optimizer.
  * Input and output configuration: Use the quantized output of the previous layer as the input for the current layer, and define the optimization objective as the difference between the floating-point output and quantized output.
  * Parameter optimization: Update the scaling factor and rounding offset through multiple iterations to minimize reconstruction error.
  * Convergence monitoring: Monitor loss changes in real time and stop optimization when the convergence threshold or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

#### `postprocess` Phase (Executed in a Layer-wise Loop)

  * Parameter application: Apply the optimized quantization parameters to the weight quantization of the corresponding layer.
  * Unwrapping: Remove the wrapping from the linear layers and restore the original network structure.
  * Forward propagation: Perform forward propagation on the quantized current layer and use the result as the input for the next layer.

#### `post_run` Phase

  * Cleanup: Remove temporary attributes from all modules to complete the final cleanup of the quantization process.

## Application Requirements

- **Low-bit quantization**: This algorithm is suitable for 4-bit quantization in extremely low-bit quantization scenarios.
- **High precision**: This algorithm maintains high model accuracy even under low-bit conditions.
- **Compute resources**: Additional optimization is required, and the computational cost is higher than that of simple quantization methods.
- **Usage limitations**:
  - This algorithm is applicable to the quantization of linear layers in LLMs.
  - Sufficient calibration data or a sufficient number of training iterations are required to optimize parameters.
  - **Low-bit quantization highly depends on effective outlier suppression algorithms. It is recommended that you use AutoRound in combination with outlier suppression methods such as [QuaRot](../outlier_suppression_algorithms/quarot.md) or [Iterative Smooth](../outlier_suppression_algorithms/iterative_smooth.md). Independent use of AutoRound is not recommended, especially for beginners who lack experience in quantization tuning. Failure to follow these recommendations may lead to a severe deterioration in model accuracy, abnormal dialogue output, or other unexpected behavior. Users shall assume all risks associated with such independent use.**

### Layer Filtering Mechanism

The layer filtering mechanism specifies the layers to be quantized through `include` and `exclude` pattern matching. For details about filtering rules, matching modes, examples, and common layer naming patterns, see [Layer Filtering Mechanism](linear_quant.md#layer-filtering-mechanism) in *Linear Quantization Algorithm*.

## FAQ

### Optimization Does Not Converge

**Symptom**: During the optimization process, the gap between the floating-point output and the quantized output fluctuates significantly or fails to converge.

**Solution**: Adjust the learning rate or increase the number of iterations.

### Significant Accuracy Drop

**Symptom**: The accuracy of the quantized model drops more than expected.

**Solution**: Increase the number of optimization steps, adjust the quantization configuration, reduce the number of layers using `W4A4` quantization, or use a larger volume of high-quality calibration data.

### Incorrect `group_size` Configuration

**Symptom**: A shape-related exception is thrown during quantization, such as: "shape '[-1, 257]' is invalid for input of size 512".

**Cause**: The `group_size` parameter must be a divisor of the `input_features` dimension of the target `nn.Linear` layer. Otherwise, group-wise quantization will fail.

**Solution**:

  - Check the `input_features` dimension of each layer in the model and ensure that the `group_size` is a divisor of that dimension.
  - Common `input_features` dimensions include `4096`, `8192`, and `11008`.
  - The recommended `group_size` values are `128`, `256`, and `512`, which are typically divisors of the `input_features` for most layers.

### Layer Matching Alarms

**Symptom**: During quantization, the tool reports a layer matching alarm.

**Solution**: Check the model definition to ensure that the `include` and `exclude` patterns match the correct layers. If the `include` and `exclude` patterns do not match any layer, the tool reports an alarm. For details about common matching failure causes and troubleshooting procedures, see [Layer Matching Alarms](linear_quant.md#layer-matching-alarms) in *Linear Quantization Algorithm*.
