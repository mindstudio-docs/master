# Standing High Tuning Algorithm

## Overview

Standing High is an automatic tuning algorithm based on quantization fallback layer selection and outlier suppression strategies. By gradually reducing the quantization fallback level (`disable_level`) and testing different outlier suppression strategies, the algorithm identifies the optimal quantization configuration that maximizes the number of quantized layers while meeting accuracy requirements. Quantization fallback refers to the process where specific layers bypass quantization and are reverted to floating-point precision.

## **Principles and Features**

### Principle

The core idea of Standing High is "reaching the peak." The algorithm first evaluates the initial settings provided in the configuration file. If they meet the accuracy requirements, it returns the result immediately. Otherwise, the algorithm utilizes a binary search to quickly locate the minimum `disable_level` that satisfies the accuracy requirements. It then progressively reduces the number of fallback layers through the Standing High process, incorporating various outlier suppression strategies to find the optimal configuration. Additionally, the algorithm employs an adaptive step mechanism to accelerate the search speed once a compliant configuration is found.

**1. Initialization Phase**

The algorithm first loads the model and the quantization fallback layer selector. It then runs the layer selector by using the calibration dataset (`template.dataset`) defined in the configuration file to determine which layers must revert to floating-point precision. The layer selector is implemented based on sensitive layer analysis, which evaluates the sensitivity of each layer to quantization accuracy based on the model structure and calibration data. Finally, it groups the layers to facilitate the subsequent selection of the quantization fallback level.

**2. Initial Evaluation Phase**

The algorithm generates and evaluates a quantization configuration by using the initial configuration (`template`) provided in the configuration file. The initial configuration is based on the quantization configuration within the `template`. If this configuration meets the accuracy requirements, the algorithm returns the results immediately and terminates the tuning process.

**3. Binary Search Phase (for Minimum Fallback Level)**

If the initial configuration fails to meet accuracy requirements, the algorithm identifies the minimum fallback level that meets those requirements by using a binary search. The fallback levels are automatically computed by the layer selector based on the model structure. A higher level indicates that more layers will revert to floating-point precision. The algorithm performs the binary search between level 1 and the maximum fallback level to quickly locate the optimal starting point.

**4. Standing High Phase**

Starting from the identified minimum fallback level, the algorithm performs the Standing High process to gradually reduce the number of fallback layers and quantize more layers:

(1) **Reduce the fallback level**: Starting from the current fallback level, the algorithm attempts to reduce the fallback level. This reduces the number of layers that revert to floating-point precision and allows for the quantization of more layers.

(2) **Traverse outlier suppression strategies**: For each fallback level, the algorithm traverses all outlier suppression strategies (`anti_outlier_strategies`) defined in the configuration file by using different strategy combinations.

(3) **Evaluate configurations**: The algorithm generates quantization configurations and evaluates the accuracy for each combination of fallback level and outlier suppression strategy.

(4) **Apply an adaptive step mechanism**: If the algorithm identifies a configuration that meets the accuracy requirements, it records that configuration and doubles the step (up to the current fallback level) to accelerate the search. If no strategies meet the requirements, the step is reset to 1 and the algorithm continues with further attempts.

(5) **Termination condition**: The algorithm terminates and returns the optimal configuration of the current record when any of the following conditions occurs: the initial configuration meets the accuracy requirements; the fallback level reaches 0 during the Standing High process and all outlier suppression strategies have been tried; or the step size reaches 1 and all outlier suppression strategies fail to meet the accuracy requirements.

**5. Outlier Suppression Strategy Traversal Phase**

The algorithm possesses a memory function when traversing outlier suppression strategies. It improves efficiency by using a starting point based on the last successful strategy. The traversal follows the order of the `anti_outlier_strategies` defined within the configuration file.

### Features

1. **Efficient search mechanism**: The algorithm uses two mechanisms to improve the search efficiency:
   - **Bisection search**: When locating the minimum fallback level, the algorithm utilizes a binary search to quickly narrow the search scope.
   - **Adaptive step**: During the Standing High process, the step is doubled to accelerate the search if the algorithm finds a configuration that meets the requirements.

2. **Strategy memory**: The algorithm retains a memory of the outlier suppression strategy traversal. It improves efficiency by starting from the last successful strategy.

3. **Step-by-step optimization**: Starting from the minimum fallback level that meets accuracy requirements, the algorithm gradually reduces the number of fallback layers to quantize more layers and find the optimal configuration.

## Application Requirements

**Inference engine support**: Pay close attention to the support for arbitrary fallback within the inference engine. Generally, vLLM-Ascend supports arbitrary fallback in single-operator mode, but it may not provide this support when hybrid operators are used. When using the Standing High algorithm, ensure the configured inference engine (such as vLLM-Ascend) supports the quantization fallback feature.

## Function Description

### Usage Description

In the automatic tuning process, start the tuning by using `msmodelslim tune`. Set `type` to `standing_high` in the `strategy` field of the tuning YAML file and configure other fields as described below. For details about the complete tuning configuration and command parameters, see [Automatic Tuning Usage Guide](../../feature_guide/auto_precision_tuning/usage.md).

### YAML Configuration Fields

#### `type` - Strategy Type

**Purpose**: Specifies the type of the tuning algorithm. When the Standing High algorithm is used, set this field to `standing_high`.

**Type**: String

**Value**: `standing_high`

#### `anti_outlier_strategies` - Outlier Suppression Strategy List

**Purpose**: Specifies a list of outlier suppression strategies, where each element is a list of processor configurations. The algorithm traverses these strategy combinations to find the configuration that meets the accuracy requirements.

**Configuration Description**

- An empty list `[]` can be configured, indicating that no outlier suppression strategy is used.
- A single outlier suppression strategy can be configured, such as `iter_smooth`.
- A mixture of multiple outlier suppression strategies can be configured by placing multiple strategies within the same list.

**Configuration Examples**

```yaml
# No outlier suppression strategy is used.
anti_outlier_strategies: [ ]
```

```yaml
anti_outlier_strategies:
  - - type: "iter_smooth"  # Only a single outlier suppression strategy is used.
      alpha: 0.5 
  - - type: "iter_smooth"  # A mixture of strategies is used: iter_smooth and quarot.
      alpha: 0.5
    - type: "quarot"
```

#### `template` - Basic Quantization Configuration

**Purpose**: Specifies the basic quantization configuration template that defines the foundational settings for quantization, including the quantization scheduler, processor, saver, and dataset. This configuration serves as the starting point for tuning. The selection of the basic configuration affects the number of tuning iterations to some extent.

**Configuration schema**: The configuration schema of the `template` field is consistent with the `spec` field in the quick quantization guide. For details, see [Quantization Configuration Schema](../../feature_guide/quick_quantization_v1/usage.md#Quantization Configuration Schema).

**Core Fields**

- **runner**: quantization scheduler type, which defines the scheduling mode for quantization processing (such as `auto`, `layer_wise`, `dp_layer_wise`, or `model_wise`).
- **process**: processor list, which defines the processor configuration for quantization processing (such as `linear_quant` or `iter_smooth`).
- **save**: saver list, which defines the mode for saving quantization results (such as `ascendv1_saver`).
- **dataset**: calibration dataset configuration, which specifies the name of the calibration dataset file.

**Configuration Requirements**

- Must contain at least one `linear_quant` processor.
- Can contain other processors (such as the outlier suppression processor).

**Configuration Example**

```yaml
template:
  runner: auto
  process:
    - type: linear_quant
      qconfig:
        act:
          scope: per_tensor
          dtype: int8
          symmetric: false
          method: minmax
        weight:
          scope: per_channel
          dtype: int8
          symmetric: true
          method: minmax
      include: [ "*" ]
      exclude: [ ]
  save:
    - type: ascendv1_saver
      part_file_size: 4
  dataset: mix_calib.jsonl
```

#### `metadata` - Strategy Metadata

**Purpose**: Defines the metadata information for a strategy. This information is used to identify and classify quantization configurations (such as quantization bit width labels) so that they can be easily retrieved and reused in the best practice library.

If the environment variable `MSMODELSLIM_CUSTOM_PRACTICE_REPO` is set before automatic tuning is started, the final quantization configuration will be written to the best practice library corresponding to this path after the accuracy requirements are met. When performing quick quantization (`msmodelslim quant`) later, you only need to specify the same `quant_type` in the same `MSMODELSLIM_CUSTOM_PRACTICE_REPO` environment. The tool will then automatically match and use the corresponding configuration from the best practice library for quick quantization based on the retrieval rules of the library.

**Field Description**

| Field| Purpose| Type| Description|
|--------|------|------|------|
| config_id | Specifies the configuration file name.| string | Identifier for a quantization configuration.|
| label | Specifies the configuration file label.| object | The label information for a quantization configuration includes the number of quantization bits and sparsity.|

    a_bit: 8
    is_sparse: false
    kv_cache: false
```
