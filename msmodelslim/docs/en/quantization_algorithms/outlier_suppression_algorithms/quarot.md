# QuaRot: Rotation-based Outlier Suppression Algorithm

## Overview

- **Source**: Academic research or industry proposed method.
- **Introduction**: Quantization with Rotation (QuaRot)
  An innovative algorithm for the quantization of large language models that suppresses outliers in activation tensors through mathematical transformation. This algorithm "scatters" outliers into multiple channels by performing specific rotation transformations on weights and activation values. This significantly smoothes the data distribution before quantization and effectively reduces quantization error.
- **Core idea**: QuaRot applies a well-constructed orthogonal transformation (rotation matrix) to balance the maximum value of the transformed activation tensor on each channel as much as possible. This prevents a single channel from requiring an excessively large scaling factor due to extreme outliers, thereby improving overall quantization accuracy.

## Preparations

Install msModelSlim. For details, see [msModelSlim Installation Guide](../../getting_started/install_guide.md).

## Principle and Implementation

### Principle

1. **Core concept**
   QuaRot transforms model weights and activation values by using an orthogonal rotation matrix (for example, a Hadamard matrix). The orthogonal matrix meets the key property of Q × Qᵀ = I to ensure mathematical equivalence of the model before and after transformation.
2. **Rotation transformation**
   Apply the transformation to the weight matrix W: `W' = Qᵀ × W`.
   Apply the transformation to the activation value X: `X' = X × Q`.
   Maintain computational equivalence: `X' × W' = (X × Q) × (QT × W) = X × W`.
3. **Computational invariance**
   The rotation transformation maintains the input-output mapping of each Transformer layer. Even if a layer includes an RMSNorm operation, computational invariance remains valid because `RMSNorm(X) = RMSNorm(X × Qᵀ) × Q`.

4. **Optimization effect**
   This algorithm redistributes parameters through rotation to effectively suppress outliers in activation values. This results in a smoother value distribution and significantly reduces the quantization error of subsequent operations, laying the foundation for low-bit quantization.

### Implementation

#### Code Implementation

The algorithm is implemented in [msmodelslim/processor/quarot/offline_quarot/quarot.py](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodelslim/blob/master/msmodelslim/processor/quarot/offline_quarot/quarot.py).

#### Processing Sequence

The following sequence diagram shows the complete processing flow of the QuaRot algorithm, including the interaction between `Runner`, `QuaRotProcessor`, `ModelAdapter`, and `LAOSOnlineRotationProcessor`.

![QuaRot processing sequence](../figures/quarot_processing_sequence_diagram.png)

#### pre_run Phase

The `pre_run` phase is executed before the `Runner` starts scheduling layers. It mainly completes the following operations:

**Obtaining Configuration Information from the Model Adapter**

- Calls `adapter.get_ln_fuse_map()` to obtain the fusion mapping between `LayerNorm` and `Linear` layers. This returns `(pre_run_fused_ln, fused_map)`,
  where `pre_run_fused_ln` is used in the `pre_run` phase and `fused_map` is saved for the subsequent `preprocess` phase.
- Calls `adapter.get_bake_names()` to obtain the list of `Linear` layer names that require mean fusion. This returns `(pre_run_bake_names, bake_names)`.
- Calls `adapter.get_rotate_map(block_size)` to obtain rotation mapping pairs. This returns `(pre_run_pairs, rotate_pairs)`,
  where `pre_run_pairs` is used in the `pre_run` phase and `rotate_pairs` is saved for the subsequent `preprocess` phase.

**Performing Rotation Operations in the `pre_run` Phase**

- Converts `pre_run_pairs` into a `RotateCommand` list.
- Executes `_fuse_norm(pre_run_fused_ln)` to fuse `LayerNorm` and `Linear` layers. This fuses the `LayerNorm` weight into the `Linear` layer and sets the `LayerNorm` weight to `1`.
- Executes `_bake_mean(pre_run_bake_names)` to fuse the mean into the `Linear` layer weight (which is typically an empty list).
- Executes `_rotate(pre_run_commands)` to perform the rotation operation on the specified layer (such as `model.embed_tokens`).

**Preparing Rotation Commands for Subsequent Loops**

- Converts `rotate_pairs` into a `RotateCommand` list and saves it to `self.rotate_commands` for use in the `preprocess` phase.

**(Optional) Exporting Global Rotation Information**

- If `export_extra_info` is set to `True`, the algorithm registers `QuaRotExtraInfoHookIR` with the first rotation target module and exports the QuaRot global rotation matrix information in the saving phase.
- After the export, the following files are added to the quantization save directory:
  - `optional/quarot.safetensors`: Contains a tensor with the key `global_rotation`. This tensor is the global rotation matrix `Q` used by QuaRot.
  - `optional.quarot` field in `quant_model_description.json`: Describes the additional export files mentioned above, facilitating file loading on the inference side based on the description.
- The structure of `optional.quarot` is as follows:

```jsonc
{
  "optional": { // Entry for optional export files
    "quarot": { // Additional export field of QuaRot
      "rotation_map": { // Rotation information mapping table
        "global_rotation": "optional/quarot.safetensors" // Global rotation matrix file (relative path)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If `export_extra_info` is `False`, the algorithm does not inject this hook and does not export the preceding information.

**(Optional) Initializing Online Rotation**

- If `online: True` is configured, the algorithm calls `online_processor.pre_run()` to perform the following operations:
    - Obtains the available devices (such as NPU, CUDA, or CPU).
    - Obtains `num_attn_heads` and `head_dim` from the adapter.
    - Creates online rotation matrices (`rot1`, `rot2`, and `rotonlineo_proj`) and the identity matrix.
    - Creates a `QuarotOnlineRotationInfo` object to save the rotation information.

#### `preprocess` Phase

The `preprocess` phase executes when the `Runner` schedules each `DecoderLayer`, processing each decoder layer one by one.

**Filtering Layer-Related Operations Based on the Prefix**

- Extract the prefix (such as `"model.layers.0"`) from `request.name`.
- Call `_filter_fused_map(prefix)` to filter out the `LayerNorm` fusion mapping related to the layer from `self.fused_map` and remove it from `self.fused_map`.
- Call `_filter_bake_names(prefix)` to filter out the bake names related to the layer from `self.bake_names` and remove them from `self.bake_names`.
- Call `_filter_commands(prefix)` to filter out the rotation commands related to the layer from `self.rotate_commands` and remove them from `self.rotate_commands`.

**Performing Rotation Operations on the Layer**

- Execute `_fuse_norm(fused_map)` to fuse the `LayerNorm` and `Linear` layers of the current layer (such as the fusion of `input_layernorm` and `q_a_proj`).
- Execute `_bake_mean(bake_names)` to fuse the mean of the current layer into the `Linear` layer weights.
- Execute `_rotate(rotate_commands)` to perform the rotation operation on the layer. The specific content of the rotation operation is obtained from the model adapter.

**(Optional) Performing Online Rotation**

- If `online: True` is configured, the algorithm calls `online_processor.preprocess(request)` to perform the following operations:
    - Obtain the `ov_pairs` (mapping pairs of `o_proj` and `v_proj`) and `up_down_pairs` (mapping pairs of `up_proj` and `down_proj`) of the layer from the adapter.
    - Extract `layer_idx`.
    - Call `online_rotate_o_proj_input()` to perform online rotation on the input of `o_proj` if conditions are met.
    - Call `online_rotate_down_proj()` to perform online rotation on `down_proj` (using a Kronecker product rotation matrix) if `layer_idx` exists in the `down_proj_online_layers` configuration.

    - Register `QuarotKroneckerRotationHookIR` for `down_proj` and `QuarotHeadsRotationHookIR` for `o_proj`. These hooks perform rotation operations during forward propagation.

#### `post_run` Phase

The `post_run` phase executes after the `Runner` finishes scheduling. It mainly completes the following operations:

- Execute the remaining fusion, bake, and rotation operations by processing the remaining content in `self.fused_map`, `self.bake_names`, and `self.rotate_commands`.
- Clear the status and empty all saved mapping and command lists.
- Call `online_processor.post_run()` to convert `HookIR` to `WrapperIR` if online rotation is enabled.

## Application Requirements

- **Model structure constraints**: The current adapter supports the Qwen3 Dense model series, Qwen3 MOE model series, and DeepSeek-V3/R1 series.
- **Tensor parallelism constraints**: If online rotation is enabled, ensure that `tp_size` is a power of 2 when deploying the model by using Tensor Parallelism (TP) in an inference engine. Additionally, `tp_size` must be less than or equal to the `max_tp_size` configuration parameter of QuaRot. Failure to meet these conditions leads to accuracy anomalies.
- **Online rotation constraints**: Online rotation typically improves accuracy but requires the insertion of online rotation operators during deployment. This implementation depends on the support of the inference framework and reduces performance to some extent. Users must balance accuracy and performance based on the specific capabilities of their inference engine.

**Notes:**

- **Basic rotation**: All supported models implement the `QuaRotInterface` and support basic rotation functionality.
- **Online rotation**: Currently, only the `Qwen3 Dense` series models implement the `LAOSOnlineRotationInterface` and support online rotation functionality. To use online rotation, configure
  `online: True`.
- For models that do not implement the online rotation interface, setting `online: True` causes an error.

### YAML Configuration Example

## Model Adaptation

### Interfaces and Data Structures

This interface group is used to enable the model to adapt to the QuaRot algorithm. The QuaRot algorithm contains two model adaptation interfaces: `QuaRotInterface` (basic rotation) and
`LAOSOnlineRotationInterface` (online rotation). If only the basic rotation functionality is required, only `QuaRotInterface` needs to be implemented. If the online rotation functionality is required, both interfaces must be implemented.

#### Data Structures

```python

### Adaptation Procedure

- **Prerequisites**
    - Ensure that all returned module references are actual module objects in the model.
    - Module paths must be identical to the paths returned by `model.named_modules()`.
    - The key and value in the returned dictionary must be the complete path string of the module, such as `"model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj"`.

- **Procedure**
    1. **(Mandatory) Implement `QuaRotInterface`**
        - The model adapter inherits `QuaRotInterface` and implements all abstract methods.
        - Implement `get_ln_fuse_map()` to return the fusion mapping between the LayerNorm and Linear layers.
        - Implement `get_bake_names()` to return the list of names of Linear layers that require mean fusion. Generally, an empty list is returned.
        - Implement `get_rotate_map(block_size)` to return the rotation mapping pairs, including the rotation configurations in the `pre_run` and `preprocess` phases.
        - For details, see the implementation of [msmodelslim/model/qwen3/model_adapter.py](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodelslim/blob/master/msmodelslim/model/qwen3/model_adapter.py) or [msmodelslim/model/deepseek_v3/model_adapter.py](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodelslim/blob/master/msmodelslim/model/deepseek_v3/model_adapter.py).

    2. **(Optional) Implement `LAOSOnlineRotationInterface` (only when online rotation is required)**
        - If `online: True` is configured, `LAOSOnlineRotationInterface` must be implemented.
        - Implement `get_head_dim()` to return the dimension of the attention head.
        - Implement `get_num_attention_heads()` to return the number of attention heads.
        - Implement `get_layer_wise_ov_pair(decoder_module)` to return the mapping pair of `o_proj` and `v_proj`.
        - Implement `get_layer_wise_up_down_pair(decoder_module)` to return the mapping pair of `up_proj` and `down_proj`.

## FAQ

### Rotation Matrix Creation Failure

**Symptom**: The input dimension of the model is not supported, causing the creation of the rotation matrix to fail.

**Solution**: Ensure that the Hadamard matrix of the specified dimension exists. Add the matrix of the specified dimension by referring to [msmodelslim/processor/quarot/common/hadamard_txt](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodelslim/tree/master/msmodelslim/processor/quarot/common/hadamard_txt), and supplement it in [msmodelslim/processor/quarot/common/hadamard.py](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodelslim/blob/master/msmodelslim/processor/quarot/common/hadamard.py).

### TP Configuration Error

**Symptom**: Accuracy is abnormal when the inference engine is deployed in TP mode.

**Cause**: The `tp_size` is not a power of 2, or `tp_size` is greater than `max_tp_size` configured in QuaRot.

**Solution**:
    - Ensure that `tp_size` is a power of 2 (such as 1, 2, 4, or 8).
    - Ensure that `tp_size` ≤ `max_tp_size`.
    - Check whether the inference engine supports the online rotation operator.

### Online Rotation Performance Issue

**Symptom**: Inference performance decreases significantly after online rotation is enabled.

**Cause**: Online rotation requires inserting extra operators, which increases the computational overhead.

**Solution**:

- Determine whether to enable online rotation based on the accuracy requirements.
- Consider using only offline rotation (`online: False`) to balance accuracy and performance.
- Ensure that the inference framework provides good support for online rotation operators.

### Model Adaptation Failure

**Symptom**: The model adapter cannot correctly identify the model structure, causing the insertion of the rotation operation to fail.

**Cause**: The model structure is incompatible or the implementation of the adapter is incomplete.

**Solution**:

- Ensure that the model is based on the Transformer decoder architecture.
- Check whether the adapter correctly implements all `QuaRotInterface` methods. If online rotation is enabled, `LAOSOnlineRotationInterface` must also be implemented.
- For details, see the implementation examples in [msmodelslim/model/qwen3/model_adapter.py](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodelslim/blob/master/msmodelslim/model/qwen3/model_adapter.py) or [msmodelslim/model/deepseek_v3/model_adapter.py](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodelslim/blob/master/msmodelslim/model/deepseek_v3/model_adapter.py).
