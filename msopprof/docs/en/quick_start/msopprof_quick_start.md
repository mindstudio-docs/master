# MindStudio Ops Profiler Quick Start

<br>

## 1. Overview

The msOpProf performance analysis tool is used to collect and analyze key performance metrics of operators running on Ascend AI Processors. You can efficiently locate software and hardware performance bottlenecks of operators based on the output performance data, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of operator performance analysis.
This document demonstrates the core functions of msOpProf based on the simple addition operator developed in the introductory tutorial. It helps beginners intuitively experience the efficiency and convenience that the tool brings to the operator development process.

This document assumes that you have completed all operations in <a href="https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msot/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/quick_start/op_tool_quick_start.md" target="_blank">Operator Development Toolchain Quick Start</a>. If you have not done so, complete that guide first for a better learning experience.

## 2. Procedure

### 2.1 [Environment] Mandatory Environment Preparation (Mandatory Prerequisite ⚠️)

🛑 **This section is a mandatory prerequisite. Skipping it will cause many subsequent operations to fail.**
This tutorial **supports only** standardized CANN container environments. It is not compatible with bare-metal machines, virtual machines, or other non-standard container deployments.

#### 2.1.1 Installing the CANN Container Environment

✅ **Strictly follow the guide to complete the environment installation:**
👉 **the <a href="https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msot/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/quick_start/installation_guide.md" target="_blank">Ascend AI Operator Development Toolchain Learning Environment Installation Guide</a>**

> ⏱️ **Estimated time in an environment with external network access: about 3 minutes**
> After the installation, you will get a standardized container environment with all operator tools, sample code, and dependent libraries preinstalled.

#### 2.1.2 Running the Environment Self-Check Script (Must Pass!)

Before the hands-on experience, **copy the entire script and paste it into the terminal to run it**. Continue only when all output shows [PASS]:

```bash
# 1. Check the container environment
[ -f /.dockerenv ] && [ -n "$ASCEND_HOME_PATH" ] && [ -n "$ATB_HOME_PATH" ] && echo -e "\033[32m[PASS] CANN container environment OK \033[0m" || echo -e "\033[31m[FAIL] Non-standard container or container not entered!\033[0m"
# 2. Check the sample code repository
[ -d ~/ot_demo/msot/example/quick_start ] && echo -e "\033[32m[PASS] Sample code repository OK\033[0m" || echo -e "\033[31m[FAIL] Code repository missing\033[0m"
```

### 2.2 [Prerequisite] Completing Operator Project Preparation

Follow section 2.3 in <a href="https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msot/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/quick_start/op_tool_quick_start.md#23-development-building-the-operator-project-msopgen" target="_blank">Operator Development Toolchain Quick Start</a> to complete the operator project preparation.

### 2.3 [Tuning] Analyzing Operator Performance (msOpProf)

If operator performance does not meet expectations, you can use msOpProf to collect runtime performance data for in-depth analysis and optimization, ensuring efficient execution across different Ascend hardware platforms. Follow the operations first to experience the effect. You can read the principles later.

#### 2.3.1 Modifying Compilation Options and Re-deploying

**1. Modify the compilation options.**

In the first line of the `CMakeLists.txt` file on the kernel side, insert the following configuration to enable debugging information:

```shell
# Go to the corresponding directory to back up files
cd ~/ot_demo/workspace/src/AddCustom
cp -f op_kernel/CMakeLists.txt op_kernel/CMakeLists.txt.bak

# Insert the following configuration at the beginning of CMakeLists.txt
printf '%s\n' "if(COMMAND add_ops_compile_options)" "  add_ops_compile_options(ALL OPTIONS -g)" "elseif(COMMAND npu_op_kernel_options)" "  npu_op_kernel_options(ascendc_kernels ALL OPTIONS -g)" "endif()" | cat - op_kernel/CMakeLists.txt > tmp && mv -f tmp op_kernel/CMakeLists.txt;
```

**2. Re-compile and deploy the operator.**

```shell
bash ./build.sh
MY_OP_PKG=$(find ./build_out -maxdepth 1 -name "custom_opp_*.run" | head -1) && bash $MY_OP_PKG
```

#### 2.3.2 Starting Collection on On-board Hardware and Simulator

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Key Point: Difference Between On-board Hardware and Simulator Collection**
> On-board hardware: precisely captures real hardware characteristics such as operator execution time, pipe usage, memory bandwidth, and cache behavior, which are often difficult to reproduce with high fidelity on a simulator.
> Simulator: provides more complete and stable analysis capabilities in instruction stream tracing and code hot spot location, but has limited simulation accuracy for hardware-related behaviors like memory access latency and bandwidth bottlenecks.
> Therefore, combine both methods to leverage their complementary advantages for comprehensive performance diagnosis. If you do not have on-board hardware (NPU) in some scenarios, use the simulator mode for preliminary performance estimation and hotspot analysis.

##### 2.3.2.1 Performance Collection on On-board Hardware

Run the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/ot_demo/workspace/src/caller/build
msopprof --output=./msopprof_output_npu ./execute_add_op
```

##### 2.3.2.2 Performance Collection on Simulator

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The value of the `--soc-version` parameter can be obtained by running `python3 -c "import acl; print(acl.get_soc_name())"`.

```shell
msopprof simulator --soc-version={Ascendxxxyy} --output=./msopprof_output_sim ./execute_add_op
```

#### 2.3.3 Viewing Performance Data Results

The tool generates results in `.csv` and `.bin` files in the directory specified by `--output`. For the generated directory structure, see [Directory Structure Reference](../user_guide/msopprof_simulator_user_guide.md#directory-structure-reference). If no error is reported, the execution is successful.

**`.csv` Files**
For example, you can see the following information after opening the `MemoryUB.csv` file:
The data shows that the task is equally divided into eight blocks, all of which are scheduled on the Vector Core for execution. For example, the bandwidth of Block 0 (1.02GB/s) is significantly higher than that of Block 1 (0.77GB/s). If the difference is too large, it may indicate room for optimization.
