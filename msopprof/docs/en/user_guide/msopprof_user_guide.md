# msOpProf Mode User Guide

## Overview

MindStudio Ops Profiler (msOpProf, an operator tuning tool) is used to collect and analyze the key performance metrics of operators running on AI Processors. Based on the output profile data, you can quickly locate the hardware and software performance bottlenecks of operators, improving the efficiency of operator performance analysis.

Currently, profile data for different file formats (executable files or operator binary .o files) can be collected and automatically parsed in the on-board (msOpProf) or [simulator (msOpProf simulator)](./msopprof_simulator_user_guide.md) mode.

- On-board mode: Runs on real Ascend hardware devices to collect accurate profile data. It is suitable for production environment tuning and problem location.
- Simulator mode: Simulates NPU behavior on the CPU, allowing preliminary verification without hardware. It is suitable for development debugging and process testing.

This document describes how to use the on-board running mode of the msOpProf tool.

**Features**

msOpProf demonstrates single-operator tuning capabilities such as the computing memory heatmap, Roofline bottleneck analysis chart, cache heatmap, communication and computing pipeline chart (for MC2 operators), pipeline chart, operator code hot spot map, and profile data files through MindStudio Insight. For details, see [**Table 1** msOpProf mode features](#msopprof-mode-features).

## Preparations

**Environment Preparation**

- Configure related environment variables by referring to the [MindStudio Ops Profiler Installation Guide](../install_guide/msopprof_install_guide.md).

- To use MindStudio Insight for viewing, install the MindStudio Insight software package separately. For download links, see the [MindStudio Insight Installation Guide](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/install_guide/mindstudio_insight_install_guide.md).

**Constraints**

- You are advised to collect profile data within 5 minutes and ensure that the set memory size is greater than 20 GB (for example, container configuration `docker run --memory=20g container_name`).
- Ensure that the profile data is stored in the current user directory that does not contain soft links. Otherwise, security issues may occur.
- During tool running, shared libraries (so files) are loaded from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Before using the tool, ensure that the content of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is secure and trustworthy, that the paths it points to do not contain soft links, and that the permissions and ownership meet security expectations and cannot be tampered with by third parties. Otherwise, there is a risk of arbitrary code injection.

## Precautions

- msOpProf depends on the msOpProf executable file in the CANN package. The API usage in this file is the same as that in msOpProf. This file is provided by the CANN package and does not need to be installed separately.
- After you press `CTRL+C`, the operator execution stops, and the tool generates a profile data file based on existing information. If you do not need to generate the file, press `Ctrl+C` again.
- If the `--output` option is not specified, ensure that other users do not have the write permission on the upper-level directory of the current path.
- Before using msOpProf, ensure that the application functions properly.
- Do not initiate more than one profile data collection task on the same device.
- You need to ensure the execution security of executable files or applications.
    - You are advised to restrict the operation permission on executable files or applications to avoid privilege escalation risks.
    - Avoid high-risk operations (such as deleting files, deleting directories, changing passwords, and running privilege escalation commands) to prevent security risks.

## Command Reference

Log in to the operating environment and run the `msprof op optional parameter app [arguments]` command. For details about the optional parameters, see [**Table 2** Optional parameters of msOpProf](#msopprof-optional-parameters). An example command is as follows:

```shell
msprof op --output=$HOME/projects/output $HOME/projects/MyApp/out/main blockdim 1    # "--output" is an optional parameter, "$HOME/projects/MyApp/out/main" is the application, and "blockdim 1" is an optional parameter of the application.
```

**Table 2** msOpProf optional parameters<a id="msopprof-optional-parameters"></a>

|Option|Description|Mandatory or Not (Y/N)|
|------|-------|-------|
|--application|You are advised to use `msprof op [msOpProf parameters] ./app` for launching, where `app` is the specified executable file. If no path is specified for app, the current path is used by default.<br>When using `./app`, add msOpProf parameters before.`/app` to ensure that the related functions take effect.<br>Currently, this command is compatible with `./app [arguments]`. In the future, it will be uniformly optimized to `./app [arguments]`.|Yes. Select either the specified executable file or **--config**.|
|--config|Specifies the absolute or relative path of the binary file `*.o` generated after operator compilation. For details, see [JSON Configuration File Description](./extended_functions.md#json-configuration-file-description).<br>Before operator tuning, you can obtain the operator binary `*.o` file in either of the following ways: <ul><li>Refer to *Kernel Launch Operator Development* > [Kernel Launch](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/910/programug/Ascendcopdevg/docs/guide/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/%E9%99%84%E5%BD%95/%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E6%A0%B7%E4%BE%8B%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E5%AE%8C%E6%88%90Kernel%E7%9B%B4%E8%B0%83.md) in the Ascend C Operator Development Guide to modify and execute the one-click compilation and execution script. Obtain the NPU executable file, and then manually extract the `*.o` file from it. </li><li>Refer to [Operator Compilation and Deployment](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msopgen/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/msopgen_user_guide.md#building-and-deploying-an-operator). The *.o file is automatically generated during operator compilation. </li></ul>Ensure that users in the group and other groups do not have the write permission on the JSON file specified by `--config` and its parent directory. In addition, ensure that the owner of the parent directory of the JSON file is the current user.|Yes. Choose one of the specified executable file or `--config`.|
|--kernel-name|This option specifies the name of the operator whose data is to be collected. Fuzzy match using the operator name prefix is supported. If this parameter is not specified, only data of the first operator scheduled during program running is collected.<br>Note:<li>This option must be used with `--application`. The value can contain a maximum of 1,024 characters, restricted to **letters, digits, and underscores (_)**. </li><li>If multiple operators need to be collected, you can use the vertical bar (\|) to combine them. For example, --kernel-name="add\|abs" indicates that the operators whose prefix names are add and abs are collected. The number of operators collected is determined by the value of <code>--launch-count</code>. </li><li>Wildcards (<code>*</code>) can be used match strings of any length.</li>|No|
|--launch-count|Sets the maximum number of operators that can be collected. The default value is 1, and the value is an integer ranging from 1 to 5000.|No|
|--launch-skip-before-match|Sets the number of operators for which data does not need to be collected. Collection starts only after the specified number of operators, starting from the first operator.<br>Note: <ul><li>The counter increases regardless of whether `--launch-skip-before-match` matches the operator specified in `kernel-name`, and the operator data is not collected. </li><li>The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 1000.</li></ul>|No|
|--aic-metrics|Enables collection of operator performance metrics. <ul><li>Enables the capability of collecting one or more operator performance metrics (ArithmeticUtilization, L2Cache, Memory, MemoryL0, MemoryUB, PipeUtilization, ResourceConflictRatio, and Default). If multiple metrics are selected, separate them with commas (,), for example, `--aic-metrics=Memory,MemoryL0`. </li><li>`Default` is enabled by default, collecting metrics `ArithmeticUtilization`, `L2Cache`, `Memory`, `MemoryL0`, `MemoryUB`, `PipeUtilization`, and `ResourceConflictRatio`. For example, `--aic-metrics=Default`. </li><li>Enables the collection of metrics within a specified code segment on the operator kernel (<code>KernelScale</code>).<br>`KernelScale` can be used to tune specified code segments on the operator kernel side. You need to configure `--aic-metrics=KernelScale` first, and then select one or more operator performance metrics. If multiple metrics are selected, separate them with commas (,), for example, `--aic-metrics=KernelScale,Memory,MemoryL0`.<br>By default, all operator performance metrics are selected for collection, for example, `--aic-metrics=KernelScale`.<br>When specifying a code segment, you need to set it before and after the corresponding code segment on the operator kernel side. For details, see [MetricsProfStart](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/910/API/ascendcopapi/docs/api/SIMD-API/%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80API/%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1/MetricsProfStart.md) and [MetricsProfStop](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/910/API/ascendcopapi/docs/api/SIMD-API/%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80API/%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1/MetricsProfStop.md) in the "Operator Debugging APIs" section of the *Ascend C Operator Development API*.<br>This function is supported only by Atlas A3 training/inference products, Atlas A2 training/inference products, and Ascend 950 products. </li><li>`Roofline`: enables generation of Roofline bottleneck analysis charts and visualization via MindStudio Insight, for example, `--aic-metrics=Roofline`.

|--instr-timeline-pipe|This parameter must be used together with the `--aic-metrics=instrTimeLine` parameter. For details, see the preceding description of the `--aic-metrics=instrTimeLine` parameter.|No|
|--kill|The value can be `on` or `off`. The default value is `off`, indicating that the function is disabled.<br>If `--kill=on` is set to enable this function, the user program will automatically stop after the number of operators set by `--launch-count` is collected.<br>Note:<br>After `--kill=on` is configured, error logs may occur due to the early termination of the user program. You need to evaluate whether to use this function. <li>For a multi-process program, the <code>--kill</code> parameter configuration takes effect only for subprocesses. </li><li>Using this parameter prevents the last executed communication-compute fusion operator from properly obtaining the API call pipeline. For details, see [Communication and Computing Pipeline Chart](#communication-and-computing-pipeline-chart). </li><li>You are not advised to enable this function together with `--replay-mode=range`. Otherwise, the collected operator data may be missing.</li>|No|
|--mstx|Determines whether the operator tuning tool enables the mstx APIs used in the user code program.<br>The default value is `off`, indicating that the mstx APIs are disabled.<br>When `--mstx=on` is set, the operator tuning tool enables the mstx API used in the user program. The following is an example: `msprof op --mstx=on ./add_custom`<br>Note: <ul><li>Currently, the mstxRangeStartA and mstxRangeEnd APIs in the mstx API are supported. These APIs are used to enable the specified range for operator tuning. For details about the parameters, see the [mstxRangeStartA](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/mstx/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/api_reference/Common/mstxRangeStartA.md) and [mstxRangeEnd](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/mstx/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/api_reference/Common/mstxRangeEnd.md) APIs in the MindStudio mstx API Reference. </li><li>When used with `--replay-mode=range`, the mstxRangeStartA and mstxRangeEnd APIs must be called in pairs and cannot be called in a cross manner. The operators contained in each pair of mstx APIs form a replay range. The streams of the operators in the replay range cannot be changed. In addition, the number of operators that can be collected is limited by the number of operator block dims in [OpBasicInfo (Basic Operator Information)](./msopprof_performance_data.md#opbasicinfo-basic-operator-information) (it is recommended that the number be less than or equal to 50).</li></ul>|No|
|--mstx-include|Enables the specified mstx APIs when mstx APIs are enabled in the operator tuning tool.<br>If this parameter is not set, all mstx APIs used in user code are enabled by default.<br>If this parameter is set, only the specified mstx APIs are enabled. The input of --mstx-include is the message string transferred when the user calls the mstx function. Multiple strings are concatenated using "\|" For example, `--mstx=on --mstx-include="hello\|hi" // Only the mstx APIs whose message parameters in the mstx function are hello and hi are enabled.`<br>Note: <ul><li>This parameter must be used with `--mstx`. </li><li>Only the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _ are supported. Use "\|" to concatenate them.</li></ul>|No|
|--replay-mode|Replay mode for operator data collection. Options include `kernel`, `application`, and `range`. The default value is `kernel`. If set to `application`, the entire application is replayed multiple times. In `application` mode, separately enabling some `aic-metrics` may lead to missing data in the `visualize_data.bin` file. To view complete `visualize_data.bin` data, you are advised to add `Default` to `--aic-metrics`. <li>If the value set to <code>kernel</code>, the kernel function of a single operator within the specified collection range is replayed multiple times. </li><li>If the value is set to <code>range</code>, multiple operators within the specified range are replayed multiple times as a whole. Multiple ranges can be specified, and ranges are independent of each other. </li>Note: <li>The `kernel` and `range` modes clear L2 cache data, while the `application` mode does not. </li><li>`application` mode is not supported in multi-device multi-operator scenarios. </li><li>Range-level replay must be used together with `--mstx=on` and is applicable only to Atlas A3 training/inference products, Atlas A2 training/inference products, and Ascend 950 products. </li><li>Range-level replay does not support collection of MC2 and LCCL operators. Atlas A2 training/inference products do not support enabling it together with <code>--kill=on</code>, <code>--aic-metrics=MemoryDetail</code>, <code>--aic-metrics=TimelineDetail</code>, or <code>--aic-metrics=Source</code>. Ascend 950 products do not support enabling it together with <code>--kill=on</code>, <code>--aic-metrics=PcSampling</code>, <code>Source</code>, <code>Roofline</code>, <code>PipeTimeline</code>, or <code>instrTimeLine</code>.</li>|No|
|--warm-up|When some operators are collected using msOpProf, they may fail to reach the minimum task time consumption for processor frequency increasing, resulting in frequency reduction, which affects the results. In this case, you can use **`--warm-up`** to specify the number of warm-up times to increase the running frequency of the AI Processor in advance, so that the data on the board is more accurate.<br>Note: <ul><li>The default value is 5, and the value range is [0, 500]. </li><li>This parameter does not take effect for the MC2 operator. </li><li>When range-level replay is enabled, the number of warm-up times must be at least 1 and cannot be set to `--warm-up=0`.</li></ul>|No|
|--output|Path for storing the collected profile data. By default, the profile data is stored in the current directory.<br>Ensure that users in the group and other groups do not have the write permission on the parent directory of the path specified by `--output`. In addition, ensure that the owner of the parent directory of the directory specified by **--output** is the current user.|No|
|--dump|Specifies whether to generate the dump file of the simulator.<br>The value can be `on` or `off`. The default value is `off`, indicating that the simulator dump file is not generated.<br>Note: <ul><li>This parameter is valid only when `--aic-metrics=TimelineDetail` is used. It takes effect only for Atlas A2 training/inference products and Atlas A3 training/inference products. It does not take effect for Atlas inference products. </li><li>This parameter applies only to the single-process scenario and does not support the scenario where two operators run at the same time.</li></ul>|No|
|--core-id|This parameter is used when the operators are evenly distributed. You can use `--core-id` to specify the IDs of some logical cores to parse their simulation data.<br>The core ID range is [0, 49].<br>Note: <ul><li>If you want to parse the simulation data of multiple cores, use the symbol "\|" to combine the core IDs.

## Tool Usage

msOpProf assists in identifying exceptions in the operator memory, code, and instructions, enabling comprehensive operator tuning. For details, see [**Table 3** msOpProf functions](#msopprof-functions).

**Table 3** msOpProf functions<a id="msopprof-functions"></a>

|Application Scenario|Usage|Displayed Graphs|
|---|---|---|
|It is suitable for performance analysis in the actual operating environment and allows users to locate operator memory and performance bottlenecks.|It analyzes running operators without additional configuration, which is suitable for quickly locating operator performance issues in the board environment.|[Computing Memory Heatmap](#computing-memory-heatmap)<br> [Roofline Bottleneck Analysis Chart](#roofline-bottleneck-analysis-chart)<br> [Cache Heatmap](#cache-heatmap)<br> [Pipeline Charts](#pipeline-charts)<br> [Operator Code Hot Spot Map](#operator-code-hot-spot-map)<br> [Warp Stall Heatmap](#warp-stall-heatmap)|

**msOpProf segment-based tuning principles**

1. Use the `--launch-skip-before-match` command to filter the operator tuning range. The filtering principles are as follows:<a id="1"></a>

    - If `--launch-skip-before-match` is configured, collection starts only after the specified number of operators, starting from the first operator.
    - If no range is configured, no filtering is performed.

2. Based on [1](#1), use the `--mstx` command to filter the operator tuning range. The filtering principles are as follows:<a id="2"></a>
    - If `--mstx` is configured, only operators within the range enabled by the `mstxRangeStartA` and `mstxRangeEnd` interfaces are collected.
    - If no range is configured, no filtering is performed.

3. Based on [2](#2), use the `--kernel-name` command to filter the operator tuning range. The filtering principles are as follows:<a id="3"></a>
    - If `--kernel-name` is configured, only operators within the `--kernel-name` range are collected.
    - If `--kernel-name` is not configured, only the first operator scheduled during program execution is collected.

4. Based on [3](#3), use the `--aic-metrics` command to filter the operator tuning data collection items. The filtering principles are as follows:<a id="4"></a>
    - If `--aic-metrics` is configured, select the collection items for operator performance metrics.
    - If `--aic-metrics` is not configured, operator performance metrics in the Default section are collected by default. Performance metrics in the KernelScale, TimelineDetail, Roofline, and Occupancy sections cannot be collected.

5. Through layer-by-layer filtering from [1](#1) to [4](#4), you can obtain the actual number of tuned operators and the collection range of performance metrics.
6. With `--kill=on`, compare the actual number of tuned operators with the value of `--launch-count` to determine whether to automatically stop the program.<br>If the number of tuned operators is less than or equal to the value of `--launch-count`, go to the next step. Otherwise, the program automatically stops when the number of tuned operators reaches the value specified by `--launch-count`.

**msOpProf configuration**

To implement the [cache heatmap jump](#cache-heatmap) function, perform the following operations:

1. Add the `-g` compilation option when compiling operators. For details, see [Adding `-g` to the compilation option](./msopprof_simulator_user_guide.md#usage).
2. Enable the `Source` option for the `--aic-metrics` parameter.

**Starting the tool**

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Currently, msOpProf does not support the `-O0` compilation option.

1. Log in to the operating environment and run the `msprof op optional parameter app [arguments]` command to enable operator tuning on the board. For details about the optional parameters, see [Command Reference](#command-reference). An example command is as follows:

    ```shell
    msprof op --output=$HOME/projects/output $HOME/projects/MyApp/out/main    # --output is an optional parameter. $HOME/projects/MyApp/out/main is the application used.
    ```

2. Perform operator tuning in either of the following ways:
    - Based on an executable file
        - Single-operator scenario (using `test` as an example)
            > [!NOTE]
            > 
            > The executable file name `test` in the example is for reference only. The actual name is subject to the executable file generated during compilation in the current project.

            Example 1:

            ```shell
            msprof op ./test
            ```

            Example 2:

            ```shell
            msprof op --aic-metrics=<select_metrics> --output=./output_data ./test
            ```

        - Multi-operator scenario

            If the `test` executable contains `Add`, `MatMul`, and `Sub` operators, you can use `--launch-count` and `--kernel-name` to specify collecting data for the `Add` and `Sub` operators only.

            ```shell
            msprof op --launch-count=10 --kernel-name="Add|Sub" --output=./output_data ./test    # "./test" is the user binary file and should be placed at the end of the command.
            ```

    - Based on the .json configuration file of the input operator binary file *.o. For details, see [JSON Configuration File Description](./extended_functions.md#json-configuration-file-description).

        ```shell
        msprof op --config=./add_test.json --aic-metrics=<select_metrics> --output=./output_data
        ```

3. After the command is executed, a folder named `OPPROF_{timestamp}_XXX` is generated in the default path or the specified `--output` directory. When all `--aic-metrics` are enabled, the structure is as follows:

## Computing Memory Heatmap

### Function Description

Visualizes the `visualize_data.bin` file generated in msOpProf. The page presents basic operator information, computing workload analysis data, and memory workload analysis data by resource, allowing developers to identify resource bottlenecks from a comprehensive perspective.

For details about MindStudio Insight operations, see the [Details](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/operator_tuning.md) section in *MindStudio Insight Operator Tuning*.

### Usage Description

The following shows the MindStudio Insight page of the `visualize_data.bin` file.

**Figure 1** Details page 1 
![](../figures/details-page-1.png "Details page 1")

- Core Occupancy displays the time consumption, total data throughput, and cache hit ratio of each physical core in a data pane, allowing developers to improve the usage efficiency of physical cores.

    > [!NOTE]
    > 
    > - Only Atlas A3 training products, Atlas A3 inference products, Atlas A2 training products, Atlas A2 inference products, and Ascend 950 products support this function.
    > - The number of cores displayed depends on the hardware.

- Roofline bottleneck analysis chart. For details, see [Roofline Bottleneck Analysis Chart](#roofline-bottleneck-analysis-chart).
- Compute Workload Analysis displays computing workload data in bar charts and data tables, helping developers analyze whether Cube/Vector computing resources are fully utilized.
- Memory workload analysis displays the active bandwidth of each MTE channel. (If MemoryDetail is not enabled, the active bandwidth of MTE1 and MTE2 channels on the Cube is not displayed.) The memory heatmap and data pane display the number of requests, transfer bandwidth, and usage of each channel. This helps developers analyze channels that may have bottlenecks.

    > [!NOTE]
    > 
    > - The content displayed in data panes varies depending on the operator type.
    > - The active bandwidth value function does not apply to Atlas inference products.
    > - Atlas A3 training products or Atlas A3 inference products do not support peak value (maximum bandwidth ratio) display.
    > - For Ascend 950 products, data display for UB read/write VEC units is currently not supported for operators containing the SIMD architecture.

## Roofline Bottleneck Analysis Chart

### Function Description

Visualizes the `visualize_data.bin` file generated in msOpProf. The roofline bottleneck analysis chart can be used to build a processor performance model. A Roofline bottleneck analysis chart can be used to build a processor performance model, which can be used to quickly evaluate the theoretical performance limit of an operator, allowing developers to quickly identify bottlenecks.

For details about MindStudio Insight operations, see the [Details](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/operator_tuning.md) section in *MindStudio Insight Operator Tuning*.

### Usage Description

**Page introduction**

The generated `visualize_data.bin` file can be visualized using MindStudio Insight. Different Roofline analysis charts are generated for different hardware and operator types.

- The Roofline bottleneck analysis chart of Atlas inference products contains only the memory unit view.

    **Figure 2** Roofline bottleneck analysis chart of Atlas inference products
    ![](../figures/Atlas-inference-products-Roofline-bottleneck-analysis-diagram.png "Atlas inference products-Roofline analysis chart")

- For Atlas A3 training products, Atlas A3 inference products, Atlas A2 training products, and Atlas A2 inference products, different views are generated based on the operator type. For details, see [**Table 5** Roofline chart support for Atlas A3 training products, Atlas A3 inference products, Atlas A2 training products, and Atlas A2 inference products](#a2-a3-roofline-chart-support).

**Usage Instruction**

The Roofline performance analysis result of each unit or channel consists of a horizontal axis, a vertical axis, a roofline, a bandwidth slope, and actual running coordinates. For details, see [**Figure 5** Roofline chart](#roofline-chart).

**Figure 5** Roofline chart<a id="roofline-chart"></a>
![](../figures/roofline-chart.png "Roofline chart")

- Horizontal axis: arithmetic intensity, which is the ratio of total floating-point operations to total accessed data in a unit or channel, in Ops/Byte.
- Vertical axis: performance, which is the number of floating-point operations executable per second, in TOps/s.
- Roofline: the horizontal line at the top of the chart, representing the theoretical maximum computing performance of the NPU. Regardless of how the arithmetic intensity is improved, the actual performance cannot exceed the hardware limit.
- Bandwidth slope: slope line that intersects with the roofline. Its intersection with the vertical axis depends on the theoretical maximum bandwidth. When the theoretical maximum bandwidth multiplied by the arithmetic intensity is less than the theoretical maximum computing performance of the NPU, the maximal computing power increases linearly with the arithmetic intensity.

    > [!NOTE]
    > 
    > The roofline and bandwidth slope together form the theoretical maximum computing power of an operator, which can be summarized as `min(NPU theoretical maximum computing performance, Theoretical maximum bandwidth * Actual arithmetic intensity)`.

- For parameters of actual running coordinates, see [**Table 7** Actual running coordinate parameters](#actual-running-coordinate-parameters).

    **Table 7** Actual running coordinate parameters<a id="actual-running-coordinate-parameters"></a>

    |Coordinate Parameter|Description |
    |---|---|
    |Bandwidth|Theoretical maximum bandwidth of the unit or channel|
    |Arithmetic Intensity|Actual arithmetic intensity during operator running (horizontal coordinate)|
    |Performance|Actual computing performance during operator running (vertical coordinate)|
    |Performance Ratio|Ratio of actual computing performance to the theoretical maximum performance under current data volume (`a/b` in the figure expressed as a percentage)|

The Roofline analysis chart analyzes the performance percentage of operators and provides the following objective analysis results:

- If the operator performance percentage is greater than 80%, a message is displayed based on the region. There are the following two cases:
    - **Compute Bound**: computing bottleneck
    - **Memory Bound**: memory bottleneck

- If the operator performance percentage is less than 80% and the bound type is latency bound, there are the following cases:
    - If the maximum pipeline ratio is less than 80%, the message "latency bound:pipeline caused" is displayed.
    - If the maximum pipeline ratio is greater than 80%, identify the type of the maximum pipeline ratio.
        - If the type of the maximum pipeline ratio is compute pipeline (cube ratio, vector ratio, or scalar ratio), the message "latency bound:compute caused" is displayed.
        - If the type of the maximum pipeline ratio is memory pipeline (MTE1 ratio, MTE2 ratio, or MTE3 ratio), the message "latency bound:memory caused" is displayed.

## Cache Heatmap

### Function Description

Displays the L2 cache heatmap using the L2 cache access data of kernel functions recorded by msOpProf. The heatmap displays the instruction information, allowing users to optimize the cache hit ratio and operator programs.

**Precautions**

- For detailed MindStudio Insight operations and field explanations, see [Cache](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/operator_tuning.md) in *MindStudio Insight Operator Tuning*.
- If the `-g` compilation option is added, the generated binary file contains debugging information. You are advised to restrict access to user programs with debugging information to authorized personnel only.
- If the functions provided by the llvm-symbolizer component are not used, do not include `-g` when compiling the program that is input to msOpProf. In this case, msOpProf does not call the functions of the llvm-symbolizer component.
- The cache heatmap function does not apply to Atlas inference products.
- The MC2 and LCCL operators do not support the generation of cache heatmaps.

### Usage Description

The following figure shows the cache heat map.

**Figure 6** Cache heatmap
![](../figures/cache-heatmap.png "Cache heatmap")

- **Hit** indicates the cacheline hits, and **Miss** indicates the cacheline misses, allowing you to analyze the L2 cache usage.
- On the **Cache** tab page, select a hit or miss event graph and click to enlarge the event graph. In the enlarged event graph, right-click the selected memory cell and choose **Show Instructions in Source** from the shortcut menu. The **Source** page is displayed, and the related instruction line is highlighted.

    ![](../figures/operator-code-hot-spot-map-corresponding-to-a-cacheline.png "Operator code hot spot map corresponding to a cacheline")

    > [!NOTE]
    > 
    > To jump from the cache heatmap to the operator code hot spot map, configure msopprof in advance as described in [msOpProf Configuration](#tool-usage).

## Pipeline Charts

Pipeline charts are classified into the communication and computing pipeline chart, Pipe pipeline chart, warp pipeline chart, and instruction pipeline chart. The communication and computing pipeline chart, Pipe pipeline chart, and instruction pipeline chart cannot exist at the same time. The warp pipeline chart can coexist with any one of the three. For details about the classification and description, see the following table.

|Name|Function|Note|
|---|---|---|
|[Pipe pipeline chart](#pipeline-chart)|Displays the running status of each Pipe of the operator.|Enable by setting the `--aic-metrics=PipeTimeline` parameter.|
|[Instruction pipeline chart](#instruction-pipeline-chart)|Displays instruction time consumption, instruction PC, call stack, and other information.|Enable by setting the `--aic-metrics=instrTimeLine` parameter.|
|[Communication and computing pipeline chart](#communication-and-computing-pipeline-chart)|Displays the running status of communication and computing, instruction time consumption, and other information.|Currently, only MC2 and LCCL operators and communication-compute operators with PrintTimeStamp enabled are supported.|
|[Warp pipeline chart](#warp-pipeline-chart)|Displays the time consumption of each warp.|Currently, only the SIMT type is supported.|

### Pipeline Chart

#### Function Description

Visualizes the `trace.json` and `visualize_data.bin` files generated after an operator is tuned. You can intuitively see the running status of each pipeline, which helps identify operator bottlenecks.

For detailed MindStudio Insight operations and field explanations, see [Timeline](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/operator_tuning.md) in *MindStudio Insight Operator Tuning*.

#### Usage Description

- The generated `visualize_data.bin` file can be visualized using MindStudio Insight. The following figure shows the active status of each AI Core unit of the operator.
- The pipeline chart feature is implemented based on sampling and is not directly related to the number of cores enabled by the user. Even if all cores are enabled, only the data of six cores is displayed.
- If data loss occurs when MarkStamp is used for marking, you are advised to reduce the number and density of mark points.

**Figure 8** Pipeline chart

![](../figures/1-2.png)

You can use the [AscendC::MarkStamp API](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/910/API/ascendcopapi/docs/api/SIMD-API/%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80API/%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1/MarkStamp.md) to perform pipeline marking at any point in the operator kernel code to identify the pipeline range. If a point with ID 13 is marked on the Vector unit using this API, **MarkStamp13** will be displayed on the Scalar and Vector units in the chart. For details, see [**Figure 9** Custom Marking Chart](#custom-marking-chart).

**Figure 9** Custom marking chart<a id="custom-marking-chart"></a>
![](../figures/custom-marking-chart.png "Customized marking chart")

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - Marking on the Scalar unit generates only one record, representing both issuing and execution. Marking on other units generates two records: one on the Scalar unit for issuing and one on the corresponding unit for execution.
> - SIMT functions do not support marking.

### Instruction Pipeline Chart

#### Function Description

Visualizes the `trace.json` and `visualize_data.bin` files generated after an operator is tuned. With the on-board instruction-level pipeline chart of the operator, you can accurately collect the actual execution time of each instruction and grasp the global instruction scheduling sequence and running status, helping developers carry out in-depth tuning such as instruction scheduling optimization and instruction sequence reordering.

For detailed MindStudio Insight operations and field explanations, see [Timeline](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/operator_tuning.md) in *MindStudio Insight Operator Tuning*.

#### Usage Description

- Use the `--aic-metrics=instrTimeLine` parameter to enable the on-board instruction-level pipeline chart function. Use `--instr-timeline-pipe` to specify the pipes supported by the pipeline chart. For example, `--aic-metrics=instrTimeLine --instr-timeline-pipe="mte1|vector"`. The supported pipes are cube, fixp, vector, mte1, mte2, and mte3. Each pipe supports a maximum of 1,024 instructions.
- Enable the `-g` operator compilation option to obtain the PC and call stack information of the instruction-level pipeline chart.
- Instructions in SIMT VF and SIMD VF cannot be displayed.
- When instructions are dense, data loss may occur. You are advised to reduce loop logic or use the `--instr-timeline-pipe` parameter to specify some pipes.
- The generated `visualize_data.bin` file can be imported into MindStudio Insight for visualization, displaying the on-board instruction pipeline chart. The following figure shows the interface.

**Figure 10** Instruction pipeline chart<a id="instruction-pipeline-chart"></a>
![](../figures/instruction-pipeline-chart.png)

### Communication and Computing Pipeline Chart

#### Function Description

Visualizes the `trace.json` and `visualize_data.bin` files generated after communication-compute fusion operators are tuned in the msOpProf mode. You can intuitively view the running status of communication and computing, instruction time consumption, and other information, which helps identify communication-compute bottlenecks. Performance marking is supported through Ascend C APIs to collect the actual execution time of code on operator blocks, for analysis and optimization of communication-compute operator performance. Currently, only MC2 and LCCL operators and communication-compute operators with PrintTimeStamp enabled are supported.

**Precautions**

- For detailed MindStudio Insight operations and field explanations, see [Timeline](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/operator_tuning.md) in *MindStudio Insight Operator Tuning*.
- If the `-g` compilation option is added, the generated binary file contains debugging information. You are advised to restrict access to user programs with debugging information to authorized personnel only.
- When the on-board pipeline chart function is used in the KFC scenario, comply with the related API usage rules. In some scenarios, data on the Cube cannot be displayed. You need to view the operator marking data based on the KFC API principles.

#### Usage Description

The `trace.json` file can be visualized using either the Chrome browser or MindStudio Insight, while the `visualize_data.bin` file can be visualized only using MindStudio Insight.

For details about how to use the AscendC API for performance marking, see **Debugging APIs** > **On-board Printing** > [PrintTimeStamp](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/910/API/ascendcopapi/docs/api/SIMD-API/%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80API/%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/%E4%B8%8A%E6%9D%BF%E6%89%93%E5%8D%B0/PrintTimeStamp.md) in *Ascend C Operator Development API*. This function can be used together with the `--custom-input` parameter to map the descid of PrintTimeStamp to a custom string for display on the communication and computing pipeline chart. If the `--custom-input` parameter is not enabled, see [Communication and Computing Pipeline Chart 2](#communication-and-computing-pipeline-chart-2). If it is enabled, see [Communication and Computing Pipeline Chart 3](#communication-and-computing-pipeline-chart-3). The following is a JSON example file:<a id="json-example-file"></a>

```json
{
    "mc2_trace_config":{
        "enable_block_time":false,
        "descid_display":{
            "65541":"all_gather",
            "0X10006":"end",
            "0X10007":"start"
        }
    }
}
```

|Field|Description|

![](../figures/warp-pipeline-chart.png "Warp pipeline chart")

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - Some code is inserted at the beginning and end of the SIMT entry, which has a certain impact on the operator time consumption.
> - Warp time consumption data is collected in an independent replay process, which does not affect other types of data. You are not advised to compare it with other types of data.

## Operator Code Hot Spot Map

### Function Description

Visualizes the `visualize_data.bin` files generated by msOpProf. On the page, you can view the mapping between operator source code and instructions, as well as the time consumption. This helps developers identify hot spot code distribution and analyze the feasibility of hot spot function optimization.

**Precautions**

- For detailed MindStudio Insight operations and field explanations, see [Source](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msinsight/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/user_guide/operator_tuning.md) in *MindStudio Insight Operator Tuning*.
- If the `-g` compilation option is added, the generated binary file contains debugging information. You are advised to restrict access to user programs with debugging information to authorized personnel only.
- The operator program must be compiled with the `-g` option. Otherwise, msOpProf will not display the hot spot map and will not call the relevant functions of the llvm-symbolizer component to implement code-to-PC mapping.
- This function does not apply to Atlas inference products.
- Operator code hotspot maps cannot be generated for MC2 or LCCL operators.

### Usage Description

The following figure shows the operator code hotspot map.
