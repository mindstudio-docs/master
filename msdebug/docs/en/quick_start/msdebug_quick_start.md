# msDebug Quick Start

<br>

## 1. Overview

msDebug is an operator debugging tool designed for Ascend devices. It is used to debug operator programs executed on the NPU and provides key debugging capabilities for operator developers, including reading the memory and registers of Ascend devices, and pausing and resuming program running status.
This document demonstrates the core functions of msDebug based on the simple addition operator developed in the introductory tutorial. It helps beginners intuitively experience the efficiency and convenience the tool brings to the operator development process.

This document assumes that you have completed all operations in <a href="https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msot/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/quick_start/op_tool_quick_start.md" target="_blank">Operator Development Toolchain Quick Start</a>. If you have not done so, complete that guide first for a better learning experience.

## 2. Operation

### 2.1 [Environment] Mandatory Environment Preparation (Mandatory Prerequisite ⚠️)

🛑 **This section is a mandatory prerequisite. Skipping it will cause many subsequent operations to fail.**  
This tutorial **supports only** standardized CANN container environments. It is not compatible with bare-metal machines, virtual machines, or other non-standard container deployments.

#### 2.1.1 Installing a CANN Container Environment

✅ **Strictly follow the guide below to complete the environment installation:**  
👉 **<a href="https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msot/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/quick_start/installation_guide.md" target="_blank">Ascend AI Operator Development Toolchain Learning Environment Installation Guide</a>**

> ⏱️ **Estimated time in an environment with external network access: about 3 minutes**  
> After the installation, you will get a standardized container environment with all operator tools, sample code, and dependent libraries preinstalled.

#### 2.1.2 Running the Environment Self-Check Script (Must Pass!)

Before the hands-on experience below, **copy the entire script below and paste it into the terminal to run it**. Continue only when all output shows [PASS]:

```bash
# 1. Check the container environment
[ -f /.dockerenv ] && [ -n "$ASCEND_HOME_PATH" ] && [ -n "$ATB_HOME_PATH" ] && echo -e "\033[32m[PASS] CANN 容器环境 OK \033[0m" || echo -e "\033[31m[FAIL] 非标容器或未进入容器！\033[0m"
# 2. Check the sample code repository
[ -d ~/ot_demo/msot/example/quick_start ] && echo -e "\033[32m[PASS] 示例代码仓 OK\033[0m" || echo -e "\033[31m[FAIL] 代码仓缺失\033[0m"
```

### 2.2 [Prerequisite] Completing Operator Project Preparation

Follow section 2.3 in <a href="https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msot/blob/26.1.0/docs/en/quick_start/op_tool_quick_start.md#23-development-building-the-operator-project-msopgen" target="_blank">Operator Development Toolchain Quick Start</a> to complete the operator project preparation.

### 2.3 [Debugging] Debugging Operator Code Using Breakpoints (msDebug)

If the operator function is abnormal, you can use msDebug to debug the operator code using breakpoints to efficiently identify the problem. Follow the operations first to experience the effect. You can read the principles later.

#### 2.3.1 Enabling Kernel Debugging

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> **msDebug requires the root permission.**
> 
> msDebug can work properly only when the kernel debugging switch `/proc/debug_switch` is enabled. However, for security purposes, the switch is disabled by default and can be enabled only by the `root` user.
> This may not be possible in many environments (such as shared development machines and containers). In this case, contact the system administrator to enable the function or experience it in a privileged container.

Check whether the kernel debugging switch `debug_switch` is enabled.

```shell
cat /proc/debug_switch
```

If the output value is not 1, run the following command with the `root` permission:

```shell
echo 1 > /proc/debug_switch
```

If the value cannot be set to 1, the msDebug function is unavailable. In this case, skip this section.

#### 2.3.2 Modifying Compilation Options and Redeploying the Operator

**1. Modifying the compilation options.**
Insert a line of configuration to the first line of the `CMakeLists.txt` file on the kernel to enable debugging information and disable compilation optimization.

```shell
cd ~/ot_demo/workspace/src/AddCustom
\cp -f op_kernel/CMakeLists.txt op_kernel/CMakeLists.txt.orig.bak
sed -i "1i\\add_ops_compile_options(ALL OPTIONS -g -O0)" op_kernel/CMakeLists.txt
```

**2. Re-compiling and deploying the operator.**

```shell
bash ./build.sh
MY_OP_PKG=$(find ./build_out -maxdepth 1 -name "custom_opp_*.run" | head -1) && bash $MY_OP_PKG
```

#### 2.3.3 Debugging with Breakpoints and Viewing Variables

##### 2.3.3.1 Starting the Debugger

```shell
cd ~/ot_demo/workspace/src/caller/build
msdebug execute_add_op
```

##### 2.3.3.2 Setting Breakpoints

After the (msdebug) prompt is displayed, set a breakpoint at line 34 in `add_custom.cpp`.

```text
b add_custom.cpp:34
```

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> **If you perform operations in the directly applied container environment, pay attention to the fact that the `/proc/debug_switch = 1` may be in a false state.**
> If you perform operations in the container environment provided by the cloud service provider, even if the `/proc/debug_switch` is successfully set to 1 and queried in the container, the status may be false. For security purposes, the underlying host machine usually isolates the `/proc` directory through mechanisms such as copy-on-write (CoW), shadow files, or overlay mount. As a result, the settings do not take effect.
> 
> In this case, setting breakpoints as described in the previous section will trigger a warning. When you run the `run` command according to the following sections, the following error message is displayed:
>
> ```text
> error: 'A' packet returned an error: 8
> ```
>
> If you cannot correctly set `/proc/debug_switch` on the host machine with the `root` permission or you do not have the conditions to switch to another proper environment, skip the hands-on experience of `msDebug` in this section.

##### 2.3.3.3 Running an Operator

Enter `run` to start the program and wait for the breakpoint to be hit.

```text
run
```

If the following information is displayed, the breakpoint is successfully hit:

```text
(msdebug) run
Process 163027 launched: '/root/ot_demo/workspace/src/caller/build/execute_add_op' (aarch64)

   31           this->tileLength = this->blockLength / tileNum / BUFFER_NUM;
   32
   33           // Set the global memory buffer and allocate the global memory area to the current AI Core.
-> 34           xGm.SetGlobalBuffer((__gm__ DTYPE_X *)x + this->blockLength * AscendC::GetBlockIdx(), this->blockLength);
   35           yGm.SetGlobalBuffer((__gm__ DTYPE_Y *)y + this->blockLength * AscendC::GetBlockIdx(), this->blockLength);
   36           zGm.SetGlobalBuffer((__gm__ DTYPE_Z *)z + this->blockLength * AscendC::GetBlockIdx(), this->blockLength);
```

##### 2.3.3.4 Viewing the Value of a Variable

Run the following command at the breakpoint to display all local variables in the current scope:

```text
var
```

Output example:

```text
(msdebug) var
(KernelAdd *__stack__) this = 0x00000000001d78a8
(uint8_t *__gm__) x = 0x000012c0c0013000 ""
(uint8_t *__gm__) y = 0x000012c0c001c000 ""
(uint8_t *__gm__) z = 0x000012c0c0025000 ""
(uint32_t) totalLength = 16384
(uint32_t) tileNum = 8
```

##### 2.3.3.5 Viewing the Register Value

```text
register read -a
```

Output example:

```text
(msdebug) register read -a
                  PC = 0x12C04120088C

                CTRL = 0x100000000003C
                GPR0 = 0x1D78A8
                GPR1 = 0x1D7E28
                GPR2 = 0x800
                GPR3 = 0x0
