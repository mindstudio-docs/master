# Serviceparam Optimizer

## Overview

**Serviceparam Optimizer** is an automatic optimization tool for serving parameters based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It supports `MindIE` and `vLLM`, automatically tuning parameters to find the optimal throughput configuration that meets latency requirements.

The tool supports simulation and lightweight modes and consists of three core functional modules:

- **Parameter optimization module**: uses PSO to automatically generate serving parameter combinations and iteratively approach the optimal solution. In addition, the Early Rejection algorithm performs early-stage benchmarks on serving parameters based on theoretical modeling, tuning experience, and partial test data.

- **Simulation module**: accurately predicts the inference duration of LLMs based on the XGBoost model. It accelerates the verification of serving parameters using the virtual timeline technology.

- **Parameter verification module**: automatically starts the serving process and benchmark tool to test parameters and obtain performance results. Currently, the supported benchmark tools include `ais_bench` and `vllm_benchmark`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The benchmark tool is about to be replaced by AISBench and is no longer supported by Serviceparam Optimizer.

Based on the modules above, Serviceparam Optimizer can automatically recommend serving parameter combinations that deliver high throughput. It can be used in the following modes:

- [Lightweight mode](#lightweight-mode)
- [Simulation mode](#simulation-mode)

The tool has been validated on LLaMA3-8B and Qwen3-8B. In principle, it does not limit the supported model types, and broader validation coverage is planned for future releases.

**Concepts**

- `MindIE` and `vLLM`: serving frameworks, which support model deployment in serving scenarios.
- `Ais_Bench` and `vLLM_Benchmark`: inference performance benchmark tools for serving frameworks.

## Preparations

**Environment Setup**
Set up an environment where serving tools (such as [MindIE Service](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/MindIE-Motor/blob/master/docs/zh/user_guide/quick_start.md)/[vLLM Server](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/ascend/en/latest/quick_start.html)) and benchmark tools (such as `vllm_benchmark`/`ais_bench`, see [Benchmark Tool Deployment](https://gitee.com/aisbench/benchmark/blob/master/README.md)) can run properly.

## Tool Installation

Serviceparam Optimizer requires msServiceProfiler as its entry point. If msServiceProfiler is not installed, install it first. For details, see [msServiceProfiler](msserviceprofiler_install_guide.md). The command is as follows:

 ```bash
 git clone https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msserviceprofiler.git # Skip this if the repository is already cloned.
 cd msserviceprofiler/ms_serviceparam_optimizer
 pip install -e .[real] # Install the lightweight version.
 ```

 To perform lightweight optimization, only minimal dependencies are required. The simulation mode needs additional dependencies.

 ```bash
 # Same as before.
 pip install -e .[speed] # Install the tool with the speed option.
 ```

 If the installation fails, try installing a third-party package with fewer dependencies. Note that this may result in lower performance when handling large datasets during simulation.

 ```bash
 pip install -e .[train] # Install the tool with the train option.
 ```

## Tool Uninstallation

```bash
pip uninstall ms_serviceparam_optimizer
```

## Version Compatibility for Simulation Mode

| Version Compatibility|     CANN    |     Framework    |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
|     Current MindIE Version     | CANN 8.3.RC2 | MindIE 2.2.RC1 |
|     vLLM Current Version     | CANN 8.2.RC1 | VLLM 0.8.4 |

**Constraints**

The tool uses MindIE images and must follow their startup instructions. In Prefill-Decode (PD) disaggregation scenarios where MindIE uses Kubernetes, users should be aware of the associated risks.

## Quick Start

1. Complete the operations described in [Preparations](#preparations).

2. Modify the configuration file. Before starting optimization, configure [`config.toml`](../../ms_serviceparam_optimizer/ms_serviceparam_optimizer/config.toml) according to your environment, including optimization parameters, benchmark tool parameters, and serving parameters. See [Configuration File Description](#configuration-file-description) for details.

3. Start optimization. After the preceding steps are complete, start lightweight automatic optimization with a single command:

    ```bash
    msserviceprofiler optimizer
    ```

    By default, the tool optimizes `MindIE` serving parameters with `Ais_Bench` as the benchmark tool.

4. View the results. The optimization time depends on the model size and dataset size, typically taking 4 to 8 hours. Upon completion, the `data_storage_*.csv` file is generated and saved in the `result/store` subdirectory under the current directory. The file records the performance of each parameter set. For details, see [Output File Description](#output-file-description).

## Lightweight Mode

**Function**

This mode prioritizes accuracy and reliability. By combining real-device testing with the parameter verification and optimization modules, it delivers reliable recommended values for serving parameters.

**Example (MindIE Serving Parameter Optimization)**

1. Modify the configuration file. Before starting optimization, configure [<idp:inline displayname="code" id="code151415418558">config.toml</idp:inline>](../../ms_serviceparam_optimizer/ms_serviceparam_optimizer/config.toml) according to your environment, including optimization parameters, benchmark tool parameters, and serving parameters. See [Configuration File Description](#configuration-file-description) for details.

2. To set environment variables for the MindIE/vLLM services, configure them before running the tool. For example:

    ```bash
    export ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
    ```

    The tool automatically applies these environment variables during optimization (applicable to both simulation and lightweight modes).

3. Once the prerequisites are ready, run the following command to start lightweight automatic optimization with a single command:

    ```bash
    msserviceprofiler optimizer
    ```

**Example (vLLM Service Parameter Optimization)**

1. Modify the configuration file. Before starting optimization, configure [<idp:inline displayname="code" id="code121419465514">config.toml</idp:inline>](../../ms_serviceparam_optimizer/ms_serviceparam_optimizer/config.toml) according to your environment, including optimization parameters, benchmark tool parameters, and serving parameters. See [Configuration File Description](#configuration-file-description) for details.
2. To set environment variables for the MindIE/vLLM services, configure them before running the tool. For example:

    ```bash
    export ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
    ```

    The tool automatically applies these environment variables during optimization (applicable to both simulation and lightweight modes).

3. Once the prerequisites are ready, run the following command to start lightweight automatic optimization with a single command:

    ```bash
    msserviceprofiler optimizer -e vllm
    ```

    To use `vllm_benchmark` in the vLLM scenario:

    ```bash
    msserviceprofiler optimizer -e vllm -b vllm_benchmark
    ```

**Output Description**

After automatic optimization is complete, a result file in CSV format is generated and stored in the `result/store` folder in the current directory. For details, see [Output File Description](#output-file-description).

## Simulation Mode

**Function**

The simulation mode prioritizes speed and resource efficiency. It invokes all modules to quickly and accurately predict throughput for each parameter set, delivering recommended serving parameters with minimal NPU resource usage.

**Precautions**

The simulation mode requires training on collected serving data. Run the MindIE inference service test script with the profiling feature enabled. See [Service Profiler Manual](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/mindstudio/80RC1/T&ITools/Profiling/mindieprofiling_0001.html) for details. Then, parse the collected profile data for model training. The profile data to be collected must include `batch_type`, `batch_size`, `forward_time`, `batch_end_time(ms)`, `request_recv_token_size`, `request_reply_token_size`, `need_blocks`, `request_execution_time(ms)` and `first_token_latency(ms)`.

**Syntax**

- train

    ```bash
    msserviceprofiler train [options]
    ```

- optimizer

    ```bash
    msserviceprofiler optimizer [options]
    ```

Other columns are the `config.toml` parameters from MindIE or vLLM.

## Appendixes

### Configuration File Description

**Optimization parameters**: `n_particles` (number of optimization particles), `iters` (number of iterations), and `tpot_slo` (latency constraint for `time_per_output_token`).
You can configure the number of particles and iterations based on the estimated time. Each particle requires time for service startup and testing. For example, if service startup and testing takes 9 to 10 minutes per run, and you allocate 8 hours for optimization, you can run approximately 50 particles in total. The recommended configuration is 5 × 10. That is, 10 particles and 5 iterations. As a rule of thumb, set the number of particles to about twice the number of iterations.

> **Note**: All of the following optimization parameters are mandatory and must not be deleted or omitted. Otherwise, an error will occur during running.

|Parameter|Mandatory (Yes/No)|Description|
|---|---|---|
|n_particles|Yes|Number of particles (parameter combinations). The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 1000. The recommended value ranges from 15 to 30.|
|iters|Yes|Number of iterations. The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 1000. The recommended value ranges from 5 to 10.|
|ttft_penalty|Yes|Penalty coefficient for `time_to_first_token` (TTFT) violations. Set it to `0` if there is no TTFT constraint. Value range: [0, 100]. The recommended value is `1`.|
|tpot_penalty|Yes|Penalty coefficient for `time_per_output_token` (TPOT) violations. Set it to `0` if there is no TPOT constraint. Value range: [0, 100]. The recommended value is `1`.|
|success_rate_penalty|Yes|Penalty coefficient for the request success rate. The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 1000. The recommended value is `5`.|
|ttft_slo|Yes|TTFT latency constraint (in seconds) For example, if TTFT is limited to 2s, set the value to `2`. Value range: (0, 100].|
|tpot_slo|Yes|TPOT latency constraint (in seconds) For example, if TPOT is limited to 50 ms, set the value to `0.05`. Value range: (0, 100].|
|service|Yes|Node role in multi-node deployment. The options are as follows:<br>&#8226;`master`: primary node<br>&#8226;`slave`: secondary node<br>The default value is `master`.|
|sample_size|No|Dataset sampling size for improved efficiency. The value is an integer ranging from 1000 to 10000. The recommended value is 1/3 of original dataset size.|

**Benchmark tool parameters**:
If `ais_bench` is used for the test, modify the following parameters. For details, see [ais_bench Usage Description] (<https://gitee.com/aisbench/benchmark/blob/master/README.md>).

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|models| Specifies a model task. You can configure it as described in [Model Configuration Description] (<https://gitee.com/aisbench/benchmark/blob/master/doc/users_guide/models.md>).|
|datasets| Specifies a dataset task. For details, see [Dataset Preparation Guide] (<https://gitee.com/aisbench/benchmark/blob/master/doc/users_guide/datasets.md>).|
|mode| Specifies the operation mode. For details, see [Operation Mode Description](https://gitee.com/aisbench/benchmark/blob/master/doc/users_guide/mode.md).|
|num_prompts| Specifies the number of prompts to run from the dataset. This parameter is valid only when `mode` is set to `perf`.|

If `vllm_benchmark` is used for the test, modify the following parameters:

|Parameter|Mandatory (Yes/No)|Description|
|---|---|---|
|host|Yes| Host IP address, which must match `host` in `[vllm.command]`. The value can be `127.0.0.1`.|
|port|Yes| Port number, which must match `port` in `[vllm.command]`.|
|model|Yes| Model path, which must match `model` in `[vllm.command]`.|
|served_model_name|Yes| Model name, which must match `served_model_name` in `[vllm.command]`.|

|others|No| Additional parameters. Use spaces to separate them, and no space is allowed within the parameters, for example, `--ignore-eos --custom-output-len 1500`. This parameter is left empty by default.|

**Serving parameters**: Modify these parameters as described in [MindIE Server Configuration Parameter Description] (<https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/mindie/20RC1/mindieservice/servicedev/mindie_service0285.html>).
You can define search ranges directly using these parameters. For example, to set the optimization search space for `max_batch_size` to 10 to 400:

```shell
[[mindie.target_field]]
"name": "max_batch_size," # Serving parameter name
"config_position": "BackendConfig.ScheduleConfig.maxBatchSize",    # Path to the serving parameters in MindIE Server config
"min": 10, # Minimum value
"max": 400, # Maximum value
"dtype": "int" # Data type
```

You can also define parameters relative to others. For example, to set `max_prefill_batch_size` as a ratio of `max_batch_size`, that is, `max_prefill_batch_size = ratio * max_batch_size (0 < ratio < 1)`:

```shell
[[mindie.target_field]]
"name": "max_prefill_batch_size",
"config_position": "BackendConfig.ScheduleConfig.maxPrefillBatchSize",
"min": 0,
"max": 1,
"dtype": "ratio",
"dtype_param": "max_batch_size" # Indicates that max_prefill_batch_size is proportional to max_batch_size.
```

When the vLLM framework is used, you need to modify the `[vllm.command]` parameter in the `config.toml` file. For example:

```shell
[vllm.command]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = "8000"
model = "/workspace/vllm/models/llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
served_model_name = "llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
others = ""
```

|Parameter|Mandatory (Yes/No)|Description|
|---|---|---|
|host|Yes| Host IP address, which must match `host` in `[vllm_benchmark.command]`. The value can be `127.0.0.1`.|
|port|Yes| Port number, which must match `port` in `[vllm_benchmark.command]`.|
|model|Yes| Model path, which must match `model` in `[vllm_benchmark.command]`.|
|served_model_name|Yes| Model name, which must match `served_model_name` in `[vllm_benchmark.command]`.|
|others|No| Additional parameters. Use spaces to separate them, and no space is allowed within the parameters, for example, `--tensor-parallel-size 2 --no-enable-prefix-caching`. This parameter is left empty by default.|

### Custom Parameter Optimization

The optimizer supports adding any vllm startup parameter for optimization through `[[vllm.target_field]]`. The configuration involves two steps: **declaring the optimization field** and **referencing the variable in `others`**.

> **Variable reference rule**: Use the format `$UPPERCASE_FIELD_NAME` in `others` to reference an optimization field. The tool automatically replaces it with the actual value of the current iteration.

#### Example 1: Enumerated Numeric Parameter (Taking `gpu_memory_utilization` as an Example)

**Step 1**: Declare the optimization field.

```toml
[[vllm.target_field]]
name = "GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION"
config_position = "env"
dtype = "enum"
dtype_param = [0.9, 0.91, 0.92]
value = 0.9
```

**Step 2**: Reference the variable in `others` of `[vllm.command]`.

```toml
[vllm.command]
# ... other mandatory parameters ...
others = "--gpu-memory-utilization $GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION"
```

#### Example 2: Switch/Composite String Parameter (Taking Compilation Config `--compilation-config` as an Example)

When the parameter itself is a complete CLI string, you can use an empty string `""` (not enabled) and the enabled form as enum candidates. The tool automatically skips empty strings and does not append anything to the launch command.

**Step 1**: Declare the optimization field.

> **Note**: TOML uses double quotation marks `"` as string delimiters. If the string content contains double quotation marks, use `\"` to escape them. Otherwise, a parsing error will occur.

```toml
[[vllm.target_field]]
name = "COMPILATION_CONFIG"
config_position = "env"
dtype = "enum"
dtype_param = ["", "--compilation-config '{\"cudagraph_mode\": \"FULL_DECODE_ONLY\"}'"]
value = "--compilation-config '{\"cudagraph_mode\": \"FULL_DECODE_ONLY\"}'"
```

**Step 2**: Reference the variable in `others` of `[vllm.command]`.

```toml
[vllm.command]
# ... other mandatory parameters ...
others = "$COMPILATION_CONFIG"
```

Serviceparam Optimizer supports parameter optimization for MindIE in A2 single-node PD disaggregation scenarios (lightweight mode only). This requires a Kubernetes deployment. Ensure that Kubernetes can successfully start the MindIE service.
Set the `kubectl_default_path` field in `config.toml` to the single-node execution directory extracted from the Kubernetes installation script. The directory structure must be as follows:

```ColdFusion

Configuration example:

```shell
kubectl_default_path = "K8s_v1.23_MindCluster.7.1.RC1.B098.aarch/kubernetes_deploy_scripts_latest" # Use an absolute path.
```

To optimize PD ratio parameters, add the following to the `mindie` section in `config.toml`:

```shell
[[mindie.target_field]]
name = "default_p_rate"
config_position = "default_p_rate"
min = 1
max = 3
dtype = "int"
value = 1
[[mindie.target_field]]
name = "default_d_rate"
config_position = "default_d_rate"
min = 1
max = 3
dtype = "share" #Indicates that this parameter is related to default_p_rate. The sum of the two values is fixed.
dtype_param = "default_p_rate"
```

### Plugin Mode

Serviceparam Optimizer supports user-defined inference frameworks and benchmark tools. You can configure them as needed by adapting to the plugin interface and registering the corresponding plugin. For details, see [Plugin Development Guide](serviceparam_optimizer_plugin_instruct.md).

### Log Description

The default log level during optimization is `INFO`. To view detailed per-iteration logs, set the following environment variable before running the tool:

```bash
export MODELEVALSTATE_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

The status of each iteration is printed to the console. Detailed `MindIE/vLLM` logs are redirected to `/tmp`. The exact file path is shown in the console output for debugging.
