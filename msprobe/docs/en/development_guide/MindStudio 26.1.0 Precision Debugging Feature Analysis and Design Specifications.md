# 1. Feature Overview

In recent years, large language models (LLMs), multimodal models (e.g., text-to-image/video), and mixture of experts (MoE) models have undergone rapid iteration, with model parameters surging from the billion-level to the trillion-level, while training data scale, context length, and the complexity of distributed parallelism strategies (TP/DP/PP) have increased simultaneously.
The underlying AI computing infrastructure has migrated from a GPU-centric ecosystem to heterogeneous Ascend NPU clusters, making cross-hardware, cross-framework (PyTorch/MindSpore), and cross-precision (FP32/FP16/BF16/INT8) deployment a norm.
Against this backdrop, precision stability has become the core lifeline for large model deployment: during training, issues such as loss oscillation/non-convergence, gradient explosion/vanishing, and NaN/Inf overflow frequently arise; during inference, problems including output drift, prediction accuracy degradation, and generation quality deterioration are common; when migrating models from GPU to Ascend NPU, precision misalignment and numerical deviations in custom operators occur frequently. Moreover, these issues are triggered with randomness, concealment, and long-tail characteristics, rendering traditional debugging approaches inadequate.

Currently, large model precision troubleshooting generally relies on manual log printing, third-party comparison tools, and scattered scripts provided by hardware vendors. Within the Ascend NPU ecosystem, the pain points are particularly pronounced:

- Severe black-box nature with a lack of observability
- Fragmented tooling without unified closed-loop capability
- The proliferation of diverse large model frameworks results in poor adaptability and high performance overhead.

To address the aforementioned pain points and fill the gap in native precision debugging tools within the Ascend ecosystem, the Huawei Ascend team developed MindStudio-Probe (abbreviated as msProbe) based on the MindStudio training toolchain. It was officially open-sourced at the end of 2025 and is hosted in the GitCode Ascend/msProbe repository.
msProbe is positioned as a full-scenario precision debugging toolkit for the Ascend ecosystem. Its core objective is to adopt "lossless lightweight, full-link closed-loop, native NPU adaptation, and large model first" as its design philosophy, thereby building full-link capabilities spanning pre-training risk pre-checking, real-time monitoring during training, fine-grained collection of anomalous data, automated numerical comparison, overflow/NaN detection, interactive visual analysis, and root cause localization. This fundamentally breaks through the black-box barrier of traditional debugging, transforming "black-box training and inference" into "white-box observability," helping developers rapidly resolve large model precision issues, lowering the debugging threshold, shortening the development cycle, and ensuring the precision stability and performance advantages of models on Ascend NPUs.

# 2. Requirements Scenario Analysis

## 2.1 Feature Requirement Sources and Value Overview

[Precision Toolchain] By enhancing usability, reducing the impact on issue reproduction, strengthening collection and demarcation capabilities in reinforcement learning scenarios, filling API support gaps, and improving graph mode localization capabilities, the precision toolchain aims to boost model precision debugging efficiency and training/inference reliability assurance capabilities.

## 2.2 Feature Scenario Analysis

The following scenarios are primarily supported:

- Tool usability: addressing issues such as missed collection, incorrect collection, and slow collection
- PyTorch graph mode: comprehensively supplementing precision collection and analysis capabilities in graph mode
- Reinforcement learning precision localization: further extending support for the latest inference scenarios in reinforcement learning, and strengthening automatic configuration checking and delimitation capabilities
- Construction of serving sub-health status awareness capability: enhancing proactive awareness of repetition and garbled output patterns

# 3. Tool Usability, Availability, and Performance Enhancement Initiative

## 3.1 Design Approach

This feature is required to support the following sub-scenario capabilities:

1. Collection support for device MD5
2. Support for the stack/construct switch
3. Support for collection blacklist
4. Statistical value collection, overflow node detection, and comparison performance optimization;
5. Visualization support for tensor-level point-to-point matching and matching capability enhancement.

## 3.2 Constraints

N/A.

## 3.3 Detailed Implementation (Module-Level or Process-Level Message Sequence Diagram from the User Entry Point)

- Device MD5 Collection Support
  - Requirement Background: The original msProbe tool only supported host MD5 computation, which was time-consuming and did not support asynchronous disk writing.
  - Requirement Description: Implement device-side MD5 computation through XOR and other methods, and integrate the device MD5 fused operator provided by the operator side.

- Stack/Construct Switch Support
  - Requirement Background: During network training, dump.json, stack.json, and construct.json are collected at each step by default. Among them, stack.json and construct.json contain substantial duplication across different steps, and it is not recommended to save them at every step.
  - Requirement Description: Stack and construct collection switches are supported. When these switches are turned off, stack and construct collection is not performed.
- Collection Blacklist Support
  - Requirement Background: Interference information exists in the network, such as empty, mask, and communication placeholder inputs and outputs. During overflow detection or deterministic comparison, such information can easily interfere with the user's ability to locate the first NaN node or the first divergent node.
  - Requirement Description: A blacklist YAML configuration is supported. The blacklist allows masking of an entire API or one or more specific inputs/outputs of that API. Results covered by the blacklist are replaced with null.

- Statistical value collection / overflow node detection / comparison performance optimization
  - Requirement background: Collection and analysis are time-consuming and require dedicated performance optimization.
  - Requirement content: Each shall be implemented independently.

- Visualization support for tensor-level point-to-point matching and matching capability enhancement
  - Requirement background: When using precision tools in reinforcement learning scenarios involving multi-framework comparison, a large number of nodes cannot be automatically matched due to name differences, structural ordering, and other factors, requiring manual intervention by the user. However, the current hierarchical visualization tool only supports point-to-point matching for statistics, and does not yet support manual matching for finer-grained tensor data.
  - Requirement: The hierarchical visualization backend shall provide a backend interface for tensor-level point-to-point matching, and the UI development shall be carried out in collaboration with the visualization team.
